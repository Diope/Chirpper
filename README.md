# Chirpper

So uh yea remaking twitter, kinda using this to improve upon somethings I've done with [Drybbble](https://github.com/diope/drybbble), I'm splitting my time between the two, basically using Chirpper to try out some ideas I have and the ones that I think are good I'll transfer over to Drybbble.
